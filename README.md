# Oi! Welcome to my code home. 🍻

I'm working for over 25 years in Media and Technology, Engineering and Architecture for fun and profit.

My focus is on [Java](https://dev.java/) ([OSGi](https://www.osgi.org), [Jakarta EE](https://jakarta.ee)) and the Web. ☕🦊

I'm the author and maintainer of several open source modules at [Apache Sling](https://sling.apache.org) and [OPS4J](https://github.com/ops4j).
